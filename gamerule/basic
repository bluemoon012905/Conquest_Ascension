Game flow: 

base rule: 
    pieces can co-exist on the same square
    you move from room to room. beginning of each room you place down your pieces. 
    each piece that weren't captured can be placed down in move 0, and the player can spend a move dropping a piece
    the amount of moves the player has is up to the initiative roll. player has base 1 move, and could get more as an upgrade. 
    each number of an initiative roll means one more move for the player

modes: 
    tutorial
    pre-written campaigns 
    ascension (randomly generated paths)

map: 
    the player traverse from board to board.
    There are different events that a play can encounter throughout the map, just like a roguelike: 
        - a place to change equipment on your troops
        - a place to shop (pieces and equipment)
        - enemy
            - small enemy, average difficulty
            - mini bosses, medium difficulty
            - ascension bosses, hard difficulty
        - there will be three acts, each act having a number of small enemies
        - 2-3 mini bosses per act
        - 1 ascension boss, at the end of each act
        - final ascension boss of the final act should be very hard. 

interaction: 
    there must be initiatives 
    before each round (acting like a room in normal rogue like), player roll initiative for how many moves they get to set up the piece locations. 


equipment: 
    pieces will have two values: 
        unit A (placeholder) - movement balance 
        unit B (placeholder) - attack/action
        unit C (placeholder) - armor/shield 
    equipment will match that, such as an equipment that give silver general movement would have
    5 A, 0B and 0C

    All chess piece would have 1B for capturing right under

    additional capturing without moving on top of will be saved as patterns centering around the piece. 

    different types of action will exist, in addition to capturing, there will be 

pieces: 
    pieces will carry the value of equipment slots. 
    pieces will carry their hit points

King: 
    special piece, inherits all behavior from pieces
    game is lost if king is captured
